 *  ICC is a method that allows to take into account the influence
 *  of arbitrarily shaped dielectric interfaces. The dielectric
 *  properties of a dielectric medium in the bulk of the simulation
 *  box are taken into account by reproducing the jump in the electric
 *  field at the interface with charge surface segments. The charge
 *  density of the surface segments have to be determined
 *  self-consistently using an iterative scheme. It can at present
 *  be used with P3M, ELCP3M and MMM1D. For details see: @cite tyagi10a
 *
 *  To set up ICC, first the dielectric boundary has to be modeled
 *  by ESPResSo particles n_0...n_0+n where n_0 and n have to be passed
 *  as a parameter to ICC.
 *
 *  For the determination of the induced charges only the forces
 *  acting on the induced charges has to be determined. As P3M and the
 *  other Coulomb solvers calculate all mutual forces, the force
 *  calculation was modified to avoid the calculation of the short
 *  range part of the source-source force calculation. For different
 *  particle data organisation schemes this is performed differently.
