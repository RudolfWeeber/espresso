/**
 * @brief Prevent object container serialization.
 *
 * The @ref ScriptInterface::ObjectHandle framework doesn't support
 * recursive deserialization. When an object container such as
 * @ref ScriptInterface::ObjectList is deserialized, the contained
 * objects are deserialized on the head node only, which leads to
 * silent bugs in simulations.
 *
 * This function needs to be called from an object container
 * <tt>get_internal_state()</tt> method to throw a runtime error
 * when the container is not empty and the MPI world size is
 * greater than 1.
 *
 * @param name        Name of the object container
 * @param n_elements  Number of elements in the container
