        Place particles at the center and borders of a square (a cuboid LB
        grid with thickness 1 in the z-axis). Particles are fixed in space
        and apply a force on the fluid. The velocity vectors of particle
        pairs that are in contact across a periodic boundary are aligned,
        such that their contribution to the interpolation is constructive,
        i.e. at time = 0 the velocity of a LB cell containing a particle
        is 100%, and at time = 10 it is still 100% (70% from the particle,
        30% from the neighboring particle across the periodic boundary).

        Below is a diagram of the time evolution of such a system.
        The magnitude of the interpolated velocity is initially 5,
        and decreases to 4 at the next time step, with a magnitude
        of 1 for neighboring LB cells. LB cells at the boundaries
        remain at velocity = 5 because they gain 1 unit from the
        periodic images.

        When Lees-Edwards boundary conditions are present, contributions
        to the interpolation are no longer constructive across the shear
        boundary due to the shear offset.

        Below is a diagram of the time evolution of such a system,
        where the shear plane normal is the y-axis and the shear
        direction is the x-axis with an offset of 3 agrid:

        The interpolated velocity at the shear boundary is equal to
        the interpolated velocity of a particle moving diagonally.
        The central particle is moving diagonally and is used as a
        reference.
