# Notes for Tutors: Grand-Canonical Monte Carlo

## Physics learning goals

After the tutorial, students should be able to explain:

* what the grand-canonical ensemble is and where it is applicable
* how to simulate in the grand-canonical ensemble using GCMC

## ESPResSo learning goals

In the course of this tutorial, students should learn to:

* to set up a GCMC simulation in ESPResSo
