# Polymer theory and Brownian motion of a polymer in a fluid

## Physical learning goals

* Getting a short introduction to the Flory theory of polymers
* Modeling the Brownian motion of a polymer
* Learning about the hydrodynamic radius, radius of gyration, end-to-end distance
* Reproducing theoretical results of the Flory theory of polymers
* Using the Green-Kubo relation to calculate the diffusion coefficient of a polymer
* Estimating the correlation-corrected standard error of the mean of a time series
* Observing the effect of implicit hydrodynamics vs. LB hydrodynamics on polymer diffusion

## Espresso learning goals

* Creating linear polymers with ESPResSo functions
* Using tools from the analysis module not based on the Observable framework
* Setting up correlators for various operations, with compression
