# Notes for Tutors: Widom Particle Insertion Method 

## Physics learning goals

After the tutorial, students should be able to explain:

* what the chemical potential is and why it cannot be measured in a simple MD simulation
* how the Widom particle insertion method allows one to measure the chemical potential 

## ESPResSo learning goals

In the course of this tutorial, students should learn to:

* set up a charged system
* use the reaction ensemble to set up Widom insertion
