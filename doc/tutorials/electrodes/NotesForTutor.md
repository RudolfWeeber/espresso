# Simulations of electrodes in ESPResSO

## Physics learning goals

### Part 1

* Give a short recap about image charges, dielectric media, ...
* Nano-confinement can exhibit a broad variety of interesting effects that can
  be studied with computer simulations!
* Electrostatics in nano-confinement: concept of a Green's function
* Discrete image charges: ICC\*

### Part 2

* Nano-confined charged liquids as super-capacitors
* Advanced Poisson-Boltzmann theory: Gouy-Chapman, Graham equation
* Limits of PB: finite ion size, correlations, ...
* Coarse-grained view: Surface charge density via ELC-IC
* How to apply a potential difference in the simulation.

After the tutorial, students should be able to:

* Explain how ESPResSo implements 2D periodic electrostatics.
* What are the limitations of the mean-field PB description.
* How to evaluate the differential capacitance from simulations.
* The basic idea of super-ionic states.

## ESPResSo learning goals

* Setting up ELC, ICC and ELC-IC simulations
* Why is choosing the ELC-gap a crucial parameter?
* Setting up observables and accumulators for the density profiles.
